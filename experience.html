<h3 align="left">D'BANQUERS ASSOCIATION</h3>
<p align="justify" style="font-size:12pt"> During my first year diploma at UiTM Machang, I have been actively involved in one of big association at UiTM Machang, which is D'BANQUERS ASSOCIATION. This association represents faculty business administration. I was elected to hold the position of secretariat of the UiTM D'Banquers Association on 13 December 2018. As a secretariat, I was involved in many of the association's programmes. </p>
<p align="justify" style="font-size:12pt"> The programmes in which I take part in to ensure that the programmes run smoothly are listed below.</p>
	<table>

<p align="justify" style="font-size:12pt"> Then, I was appointed secretary of D'BANQUERS ASSOCIATION for the 2019/2020 session in the second half of 2019. As one of the members with a voice and responsibility in the association, I was required to participate in a few programmes run by the Student Leadership Unit, which is part of the Student Affairs Division. </p>

<h3 align="left">WORK EXPERIENCE</h3>
<p align="justify" style="font-size:12pt">During recess at my high school, I used to work as a salesperson at KIOSK. That experience taught me how to communicate with a large number of customers, as well as how to receive stock, handle transactions, and inform suppliers about product availability. </p>
<p align="justify" style="font-size:12pt"> I also become a salesperson in my diploma year at BIZMART. BIZMART is a D'BANQUERS ASSOCIATION shop, so as a member of the association, I will undoubtedly be one of the salespeople there. So my high school experience has been enhanced because I am dealing with larger customers, a larger supplier, and a larger stock than before.</p>
